# Editor Helpers
This plugin extends the capabilities of the Trackmania map editor by providing a user interface to some currently
unexposed APIs. Over time the number of features and functions in the plugin has grown to be quite numerous, and is
constantly expanding as new ideas are proposed. Some notable features include:

* Persistant Show/Hide Block Helpers
* Exact rotation angle control of Items and Freeblocks
* Manipulation of any Item's placement grid or pivot point without the need to resave
* Additional hotkeys, such as "A" to toggle Air Block Mode
* Quicksave button, to resave a map in one click (no dialogs!)
